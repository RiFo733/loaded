Truck Tracker (working title)

## User Story
​
AS A user, I want to be able to Get Driver and Load Data and have it displayed dynamically on the page in a shorthand list, an expanded details component and visual aid such as a timeline for that day

I would like to be able to Add drivers and loads as neccesary and relate them to each other as necessary as new assignments are issued and saved
​
The shorthand list would chronologically display all of the active loads, from pickups today, dropoffs today and enroutes.

The expanded details component will be dynamic and it will be populated with whichever list item you click on, it will contain all data associated and potentially a map pluggin of the drivers current location


I would also like to have a page to query all data past present or future and return it in a full page display for reference.

If possible on the main page i would like some sort of visual aid like a timeline or graph display that days data in a more appealing way



This app will use 

Node Exrpress and mySQL as well as handlebars as a template engine
It will post and get data from our data base, as well as potentially call an api to supplement the database
It use an additional technology, maybe involving date and time but has yet to been determined.
